## Project Overview

Codifica is a web-based application designed to lower the barrier to entry for Spanish-speaking individuals in the technology industry. The platform addresses the challenge of a language gap in coding education by providing a comprehensive, multilingual learning environment.

Our objective is to empower aspiring developers by offering:
  
  - Real-time code execution in a sandboxed environment.
  
  - AI-powered code explanations and technical definitions in the user's native language.
  
  - Seamless translation of the user interface and educational content.

*By integrating robust code execution with on-demand, language-specific support, Codifica fosters an inclusive pathway into programming for a diverse global audience.*
