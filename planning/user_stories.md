# Project Proposal

Pod Members: **Luis-Angel Moreno, Heiryn Hernandez Rojas, Joanna Echeverri Porras**

## Problem Statement

Spanish-speaking beginners face significant barriers when trying to break into the tech industry. The majority of technical documentation, coding tutorials, and educational platforms are in English. This creates a language barrier that can deepen inequities in access to technology education.

**ðŸŽ¯ Target Audience:**  
Spanish-speaking individuals with little to no prior coding experience who want to learn programming in their native language.


## User Roles

"Learner": a spanish-speaking user who is a beginner in tech

## User Personas


## User Stories

1. **As a user, I want to copy and paste code into the IDE, so that I can quickly test what Iâ€™m learning.**
2. **As a user, I want to see an output panel with code results and explanations in Spanish so that I can learn through feedback.**
3. **As a user, I want to search for tech terms in a glossary so that I can better understand documentation.**
4. **As a user, I want to see visual highlights linking code to explanations so that I can follow the logic.**
5. **As a user, I want to create a profile so that I can save my code and progress.**
6. **As a user, I want to see real-world examples in Spanish so that I can relate better to the material.**
7. **As a user, I want to choose between different difficulty levels, so that I can learn at my own pace.**
