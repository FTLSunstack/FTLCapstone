# Project Proposal

Pod Members: **Luis-Angel Moreno, Heiryn Hernandez Rojas, Joanna Echeverri Porras**

## Problem Statement

Spanish-speaking beginners face significant barriers when trying to break into the tech industry. The majority of technical documentation, coding tutorials, and educational platforms are in English. This creates a language barrier that can deepen inequities in access to technology education.

**ðŸŽ¯ Target Audience:**  
Spanish-speaking individuals with little to no prior coding experience who want to learn programming in their native language.


## User Roles

"Learner": a spanish-speaking user who is a beginner in tech

## User Personas

- Maria is a student whose first language is Spanish, she immigrated not too long ago so she isn't too comfortable in English yet. However she is very intersted in learning how to code and is in need of a good resource catered to her needs.
- Jose is a a 30 year old whose language he's most comfortable with is Spanish. He is looking to switch careers but he is struggling...
