# Project Proposal

Pod Members: **Luis-Angel Moreno, Heiryn Hernandez Rojas, Joanna Echeverri Porras**

## Problem Statement

Spanish-speaking beginners face significant barriers when trying to break into the tech industry. The majority of technical documentation, coding tutorials, and educational platforms are in English. This creates a language barrier that can deepen inequities in access to technology education.

**ðŸŽ¯ Target Audience:**  
Spanish-speaking individuals with little to no prior coding experience who want to learn programming in their native language.


## User Roles

"Learner": a spanish-speaking user who is a beginner in tech

## User Personas
