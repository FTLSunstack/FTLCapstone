Pod Members: **Luis-Angel Moreno, Heiryn Hernandez Rojas, Joanna Echeverri Porras**

## Problem Statement

Spanish-speaking beginners face significant barriers when trying to break into the tech industry. The majority of technical documentation, coding tutorials, and educational platforms are in English. This creates a language barrier that can deepen inequities in access to technology education.

**ðŸŽ¯ Target Audience:**  
Spanish-speaking individuals with little to no prior coding experience who want to learn programming in their native language.


## User Roles

"Learner": a spanish-speaking user who is a beginner in tech

## User Personas

- Maria is an 18-year-old student from El Salvador who recently moved to the U.S. Spanish is her first language, and sheâ€™s still getting comfortable with English, especially when it comes to technical terms. Sheâ€™s curious about coding and wants to explore computer science, but finds most tutorials too hard to follow. She mainly uses her phone to access learning resources and would benefit from short, clear explanations in Spanish. She wants a site that feels approachable and meets her where sheâ€™s at.
- Jose is a 30-year-old from Miami with a background in retail. Heâ€™s fluent in Spanish and has basic knowledge of Python from online courses. Heâ€™s looking to switch into tech but struggles with confidence and understanding English-based documentation. He typically uses a laptop and studies in the evenings. He needs a tool that gives clear, Spanish-language support and tracks his learning progress so he can stay motivated and build toward a real career shift.
