## Problem Statement

Many Spanish-speaking beginners interested in learning how to code or enter the tech industry struggle to find accessible, high-quality educational resources in their native language. Most tutorials, documentation, and coding platforms are primarily in English, creating a language barrier that makes it harder for them to enter or feel confident in the tech field.

## Description

Codifica is a full-stack web application built with the PERN (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. Its main purpose is to make coding education more accessible for Spanish-speaking beginners by providing a platform where they can learn core programming concepts in their native language. Codifica aims to break down language barriers in tech education. Users will interact with an in-browser coding environment, interactive explanations, receive AI-generated Spanish explanations for code output, and access a glossary translating English tech terms into Spanish with examples. A chatbot feature allows learners to ask questions and get guidance in Spanish, creating an inclusive and supportive learning environment tailored to their needs.

## Expected Features List

- [x] Interactive coding environment (Python or JavaScript)  
- [x] Real-time code execution in a sandbox environment  
- [x] Spanish explanations for code output  
- [x] AI-powered chatbot for Q&A in Spanish  
- [x] Glossary of tech terms (English to Spanish)  
- [x] User authentication and profile tracking  

## Related Work

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com), [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org), and [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com)  
  These platforms offer useful tutorials but are mostly in English.

- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com), [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)  
  These tools can explain code but are not tailored for Spanish learners or structured learning.

## Open Questions

- Should the IDE support both **Python and JavaScript**, or focus on one?  
- How can we ensure **accurate and culturally relevant** translations/explanations?  
- Where should we integrate **AI agents** into the platform?  
- What frameworks or resources best support **MCP-style learning**?
