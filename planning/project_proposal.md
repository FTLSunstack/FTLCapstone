## Problem Statement

Insert your groups problem statement and target audience.
Many Spanish-speaking beginners interested in learning how to code struggle to find accessible, high-quality educational resources in their native language. Most tutorials, documentation, and coding platforms are primarily in English, creating a language barrier that makes it harder for them to enter or feel confident in the tech field.


## Description

Codifica is a full-stack web application built with the PERN (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. Its main purpose is to make coding education more accessible for Spanish-speaking beginners by providing a platform where they can learn core programming concepts in their native language. Codifica aims to break down language barriers in tech education. Users will interact with an in-browser coding environment, interactive explanations, receive AI-generated Spanish explanations for code output, and access a glossary translating English tech terms into Spanish with examples. A chatbot feature allows learners to ask questions and get guidance in Spanish, creating an inclusive and supportive learning environment tailored to their needs.
