## Problem Statement and Description

Many Spanish-speaking beginners interested in learning how to code struggle to find accessible, high-quality educational resources in their native language. Most tutorials, documentation, and coding platforms are primarily in English, creating a language barrier that makes it harder for them to enter or feel confident in the tech field. This lack of native-language resources can hinder their progress, reinforce inequalities, and prevent talented individuals from pursuing careers in technology.

## User Roles

"Learner": a spanish-speaking user who is a beginner in tech

## User Personas

- Maria is an 18-year-old student from El Salvador who recently moved to the U.S. Spanish is her first language, and she’s still getting comfortable with English, especially when it comes to technical terms. She’s curious about coding and wants to explore computer science, but finds most tutorials too hard to follow. She mainly uses her phone to access learning resources and would benefit from short, clear explanations in Spanish. She wants a site that feels approachable and meets her where she’s at.
- Jose is a 30-year-old from Miami with a background in retail. He’s fluent in Spanish and has basic knowledge of Python from online courses. He’s looking to switch into tech but struggles with confidence and understanding English-based documentation. He typically uses a laptop and studies in the evenings. He needs a tool that gives clear, Spanish-language support and tracks his learning progress so he can stay motivated and build toward a real career shift.
