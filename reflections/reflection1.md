## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

- Our IDE effectively executes input code using the Judge0 and CodeMirror APIs. 
- Our application routes are appropriately corrected, requiring user authentication and login. 
- Frontend has functionality and backend connectivity.
- All of the main pages for our website are implemented on the Frontend.


* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

- This week, our group faced challenges with the implementation of Judge0 and complications with its input. More specifically, the code executor works in most cases, but when the code prompts the user to input information, it wont work because Judge0 is not able to work in real time. However, the work around we found for this is having a separate information input box so that the user can input the code and the information at the same time so that it works as intended. This way the user can still receive explanations and feedback on their code.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

- Yes, we finished all the necessary tasks in our sprint plan for this week. In fact, we had a lot of progress in a short period of time that got a lot of our applications main functionality working. The user authentication was the thing that took longer than expected but despite that we are still ahead of schedule and in a good part of our progress. This upcoming week we plan to prioritize the LLM implementation to finish our MVP early in the week and then be able to deal with potential bugs and pivots later in the week.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

- Yes, the resources given to us by the codepath team helped us plan accordingly for Sprint 1, especially the advice given to us by the instructors. Some of the advice given like using trello to plan out our sprints, making sure to break down most features into a ticket, allowed us to go through our task efficiently and effectively, allowing us to get most of the MVP completed, and putting us in a good position for Sprint 2 next week.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

- Currently, one of the user stories that might be at right would be the ability for the user to switch between programming languages. Due to having so many different features to implement, we decided we’d rather make sure all of the functionality works fully with our one language of Python first, and then as a last stretch feature, we will add other programming languages.
