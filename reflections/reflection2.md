## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 We were able to get all of our MVP up and running. All the features are functional on both the back and frontend and we were able to sucessfully deploy it all. 

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 We faced a lot of issues with the deployment. We did have to deviate in terms of the library we were using to send our forget password emails due to deployment restrictions and also had to manually import the glossary terms instead which took longer but we got that done. However, there remains the issue where our deployed site is difficult to access using our bought domain and sometimes does not open.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

Yes, this week we manged to finsish all our planned tasks. A lot of what we have remaining are bug issues which should be relatively easy to implement. We did have to deviate in terms of the library we were using to send our forget password emails due to deployment restrictions and also had to manually import the glossary terms instead which took longer but we got that done. The remaining stretch features tasks will be implemented by our estimation of the amount of work and time we believe we should dedicate to finish. 

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

Yes, we found that a lot of our planning helped us out for our sprint as we quickly connected the example code of our personal projects into our capstone. This helped for a better understand of the apis and materials we're using such as the IDE. However, we did find that we could have used a little more preparing for deployment due to unexpected changes.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

There are no exact stories that are technically at risk for our project. The only issues we are encountering are occasional bugs with deployment that could technicaly cause easy access to our site to be restricted.
