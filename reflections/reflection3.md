## Reflection Questions

- Name at least one successful thing this week.

The bug bash we had really helped us out figuring out the issues we had. For example, we had a specific issue where on our deployed version, the user was logged out when they refreshed, so we had to figure out why the local version was not doing that but the deployed version was doing that. The issue was that a change in the local prisma schema was made but it had not yet been migrated to the deployed version, but working with instructors, we were able to figure out the command that we had to run to make sure that the local db and the hosten db were matching.

- What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

Our main challenges were bugs we had with our project. For example, one of the more prominent bugs we had was one with profile page, were when editing user information and saving it, the information was not displaying, so we had to work around with a couple of things like AuthContext to make sure that the user information was saved correctly to the correct user and it was displayed after clicking the save button.

- Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list? (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

We did finish all of the task for this sprint demo, we found that most of the stuff we had for this sprint were UI related or fixing up bugs, so we were able to finish all of the bugs we had planned to fix and most of the UI changes.

- Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

Yes we found that our planning from the prior sprints and this sprint set us up to come into our last week well prepared for our demos. In general we think that the only main issues we are with the deployment, but even for that we have over came most of the bugs we had with deployment, the only main thing is that our domain is sometimes blocked by the salesforce internet, but that has a easy work around by using non salesforce internet or guest internet.

- Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

There are no real user stories at risk, I would say all of the user stories have been met, for now there might be some bugs we have to take a look at in regards to deployment, but all of the main functionality of the application is complete and we have no major or website breaking bugs.
